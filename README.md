# LaserHarpQTArduinoV1

## LaserHarp:

A free project produced during our third year at epitech which aimed to produce a harp where the strings would be replaced by lasers.

Operation is simple, once a laser beam is obstructed, an arduino board will detect the action and send a midi signal to computer software such as frutiloops studio.

## How to use:

- First of all, install fl studio and arduino.

- Download the laserharp application on this link : https://mega.nz/file/Bs4UiRLb#QB0Ioh-CdMwjzNtau4BtyKH7m5LyN9ZfPZYFHF95R7k

- Connect the battery.

- Connect the midi cable to your computer.

- Televerse the arduino program linkQtFlstudio in the arduino card.

Without Application:
  - You can play manually the harp by passing your hands through the lasers.

With the application:
  - Start the app previously downloaded with the executable LaserHarp.exe.

  - Select the automatic mode or the manual mode.


### Manual mode:

- Once you are on the manual mode, you just have to press the "start" button and pass your hand through the lasers in order to play the different sounds attributed to them.

### Automatic mode:

- Once you are on the automatic mode, you will have a text area in which you can insert different notes (such as c1 c2 c3 c4 d4 d2 ...) separated by a space.

- Once the notes are set, you can press the "send" button to send the series of notes which will be played on the computer music software.


### Important /!\

- Before quit the app, don't forget to go back on the home page.

## Why this project ?

The desire to mix music and technology made us think of making a harp with lasers. By researching on the internet we learned that this technology already existed. Seeing the final result that this could give we decided to make our own “Laser Harp”.

Our motivation due to this project: for my part (Samuel Missonnier) it is the music being a composer as well as the learning of electronics as well as Arduino and for Benjamin Nouzille the use of electronics (in particular the lasers) and learning about Arduino technology.

The final result of this project will be a harp where the strings will be replaced by laser diodes, by cutting the emission of the laser to the receiver by our hand a musical note will be emitted, it will be possible to choose a certain type of instrument ( harp, piano…).
